*You're Done!*

The broadcaster account you used will now have exclusive access to the live graphics from your campaign. You may now share that live graphic rotation, located at api.adv.gg/browsersource/{broadcaster account name}/, to any other broadcaster. They can add this URL as an extra browsersource on their broadcasting software of choice.
