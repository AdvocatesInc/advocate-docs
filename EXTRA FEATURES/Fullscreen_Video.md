Fullscreen Video
================
*Fullscreen Video* is a component type that allows for broadcasters to individually and manually trigger videos to play on their *browsersource* using their broadcaster dashboard. This allows for brands or teams to show promotional content at the broadcaster's leisure with Advocate's built-in attribution features. On each video play, a timestamp is recorded to determine the amount of viewers for a broadcaster at that particular time, allowing Advocate to count impressions on *Fullscreen Videos*.

#### How to add a Fullscreen Video
1. Navigate to the Components tab of your campaign or sponsorship
2. Click on the "Add New Component" button at the top right of the tab
3. Select the "Fullscreen Video" component type
4. Enter a reference name for the component
5. Upload a video file, or copy and paste a video link from YouTube or Vimeo
6. (optional) Select a corresponding *Chatbot Command* Component to be posted in the broadcaster's channel on every play
