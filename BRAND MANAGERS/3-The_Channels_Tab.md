### Channel Broadcaster Actions
Broadcaster actions are sent to channels in a campaign when you create a *Banner Graphic* or *Suggested Tweet* component. You may see dispatched actions for a broadcaster on their *Broadcaster Action List* at the top right of a channel. If a broadcaster incorrectly marked an action as complete, you may resend the action by clicking on the "Mark Incomplete" button.

Each channel is sent default actions for preliminary campaign setup when they first join a campaign. You may see the status of these actions by toggling "See default actions" on the broadcaster action modal.
