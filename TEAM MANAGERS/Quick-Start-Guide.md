# Quick Start Guide

### Invite broadcasters to your team
On the Team Dashboard page, open the invitation modal by selecting "Invite to Team" from the dropdown menu. Sharing an invite link with your team members will allow them to log in through Twitch to both create their Advocate broadcaster accounts and be added to your team. Once they're on you'll be able to automatically assign sponsorships and components for them.

### Create your sponsor campaigns
1. Add your sponsors by selecting "Add a Sponsor" from the dropdown menu, then click on one to open the overview tab for that sponsor campaign.
2. Create your desired Target Links. These are the target URLs you want campaign component to lead to. They are necessary for components such as Banner Graphics and Chat Bot Messages.
3. On the Components tab, for each component you wish to create, click on Add New and fill out the component form.

**Using the link-to-text tool**: For text-based components that require a target link, youâ€™ll need to use the link-to-text tool. To add a link to your message, select it from the target link drop down on the component form. Then, click on insert link to insert a link placeholder to your message. This will allow the platform to automatically place different tracking links into the final messages that get sent to your broadcasters.
