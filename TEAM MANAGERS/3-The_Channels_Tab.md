3. The Channels Tab
================

The Channels Tab contains all of the broadcasters associated with your campaign along with their individual metrics. Use the Detailed Channel view to see additional metrics. The Add Label button allows you to specify a new or existing labels for that channel. Only components with a matching label, or no labels at all, will be sent to that broadcaster.

## Metrics On This Tab

**Total Visits**: The total sum of all clicks to a **Target Link** from any of the campaign's components.

**Average CVM**: Average clicks per million viewed minutes recorded for this campaign.

**Twitch Viewable Minutes**: The total broadcast time of this channel within the campaign since the campaign's inception.

**Peak Viewers**: The total peak viewers for this channel at a single time during the campaign.

**Average Viewers**: The average concurrent viewers for this channel within the campaign.

**Component Clicks**: The total sum of clicks for a specific component type.


### Adding Channel Labels
1. Navigate to the Channels Tab of your desired campaign
2. Open the label modal for a specific channel using the *eye* icon at the top right
3. Enter your unique label tag and click the "Add Label" button


### Channel Broadcaster Actions
Broadcaster actions are sent to channels in a campaign when you create a *Banner Graphic* or *Suggested Tweet* component. You may see dispatched actions for a broadcaster on their *Broadcaster Action List* at the top right of a channel. If a broadcaster incorrectly marked an action as complete, you may resend the action by clicking on the "Mark Incomplete" button.

Each channel is sent default actions for preliminary campaign setup when they first join a campaign. You may see the status of these actions by toggling "See default actions" on the broadcaster action modal.
