The Channels Tab
================

The Channels Tab contains all of the broadcasters associated with your sponsorship along with their individual metrics. Use the Detailed Channel view to see additional metrics. The Add Label button allows you to specify a new or existing labels for that channel. Only components with a matching label, or no labels at all, will be sent to that broadcaster.

Basic and detailed stats are available from 30-day, 90-day, or all-time data from the data range dropdown at the top left.

### Channel Broadcaster Actions
Broadcaster actions are sent to channels in a sponsorship when you create a *Banner Graphic* or *Suggested Tweet* component. You may see dispatched actions for a broadcaster on their *Broadcaster Action List* at the top right of a channel. If a broadcaster incorrectly marked an action as complete, you may resend the action by clicking on the "Mark Incomplete" button.

Each channel is sent default actions for preliminary sponsorship setup when they first join a sponsorship. You may see the status of these actions by toggling "See default actions" on the broadcaster action modal.
