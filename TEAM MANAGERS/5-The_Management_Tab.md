The Management Tab
================

The Management Tab contains sponsorship management tools for broadcaster participation in the sponsorship, as well as the optional *Chatbot* account selection for manager accounts with elevated permissions.

## The Sponsor Staging Area

Broadcasters on a sponsorship can either be *active* or *inactive*. If *inactive*, they will appear under the *Inactive Broadcasters* section of the management tab and will receive all relevant sponsorship broadcaster actions such as their *Banner Graphic* assets. This area exists to allow a broadcaster to set up their sponsorship assets prior to being activated in the sponsorship. Live *Component Types* such as *Chat Bot Messages* or *Live Graphics* will not appear while a broadcaster is set as Inactive.

Only when a broadcaster is *active* under the *Active Broadcasters* column of the management tab will they begin to accumulate *Viewable Minutes* to be counted towards this sponsorship.

If a broadcaster becomes unable to fulfill the requirements of the sponsorship at a later time, he may be placed back into the *Inactive Broadcasters* section by clicking on the *Deactivate* button to the right of the broadcaster's name under the *Active Broadcasters* section of the management tab. The platform will save the time periods where the broadcaster was active, and will continue to count his metrics towards the sponsorship.

## Adding a broadcaster to your sponsorship

1. Click the "Add a Broadcaster" button to open the broadcaster modal.
2. Type your broadcaster's name in the input field and click "Add" to add them to the sponsorship.

# Campaign Settings
---
### Automatically add new broadcasters to this campaign // Manually add new broadcasters to this campaign
This setting decides whether new broadcasters added to your team will be automatically added to this sponsor campaign. If the manual option is selected, broadcasters will need to be added individually using the "Add a Broadcaster" modal.

### Broadcasters are added as active to this campaign // Broadcasters are added as inactive to this campaign
This setting decides whether new broadcasters on this sponsor campaign are added directly to the campaign as *active* participants, or if they should be added as *inactive* participants until a manager approves them and activates them individually.

### Setting the Twitch Chat Bot account

`Chatbot Accounts should not be used as a regular broadcaster account on Advocate. If you sign in to a broadcaster dashboard using a designated chatbot account, the chat bot will lose permission to post through that account`

The Advocate *Twitch Chat Bot* will post through the Twitch account *advogg* by default. To allow the chat bot to post through a specific Twitch Account, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are either signed in to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) with the account you wish to use, or not signed in with any other account.
2. Navigate to the Management Tab of your desired sponsorship.
3. Click on the "Twitch Chat Bot Account" button to open the *Chatbot Account* modal.
4. Click on the "Authorize New Twitch Account" button to log in with the account you wish to use, and accept all permissions.
