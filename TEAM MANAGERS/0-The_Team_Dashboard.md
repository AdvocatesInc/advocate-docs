The Team Dashboard
================

The Team Dashboard contains an overview of each team under a Team Manager account, as well as management options for each team. Each broadcaster on a team is listed out, sortable and filterable, as well as all campaign sponsors (sponsorships). Top-level team metrics are displayed as well as broadcaster-level metrics. You may select a date range for this data from 30-day, 90-day, or all-time data.

## Metrics On This Tab (Broadcasters)
**Hours Streamed**: The cumulative broadcast time of a broadcaster from the selected date range.

**Average Viewers**: The average concurrent viewers for a specific broadcaster from the selected date range.

## Metrics On This Tab (Team)
**Total Viewable Minutes**: The total watched broadcast time of all broadcasters in the team.

**Total Clicks**: The total sum of all clicks to a **Target Link** from all team sponsors.

**Average CVM**: Average clicks per million viewed minutes recorded from all team sponsors.

**Average Viewers**: The average concurrent viewers across all broadcasters in the team.

**Team Members**: The number of broadcasters associated to the team.

**Active Sponsors**: The number of active sponsors for the team.

Note: Viewable minutes for a specific broadcaster is equivalent to *Hours Streamed* x 60 x *Average Viewers*

## The Game Breakdown
The game breakdown contains a list of all games streamed by team members. Each row indicates the game name, total watched hours _(Viewable Minutes / 60)_, and hours broadcast by your team members.

## Inviting Team Members
1. Click on "Invite to Team" under the dropdown menu at the top right of your Team Preview to open the invitation modal.
2. Type your broadcaster's name in the input field and click "Send" to send an invitation, or copy and paste the invite link using your communication method of choice. Note: If a broadcasterâ€™s name is not appearing in the autosuggest, they have not yet logged in through Twitch.

If you sent them an invitation, the broadcaster will then be prompted to log into their dashboard by receiving an email notifying them of the invitation. Once they log in, they will see a team invitation at the top of their dashboard, with the option to accept or decline. You may see all active invites under the "See Sent Invites" modal of drop down menu.

If you sent them an invite link, the broadcaster will be prompted to log in through Twitch, and will automatically join the team once signed in. If no broadcaster account was found for their Twitch account, Advocate will create their account & dashboard, and automatically add them to the team.

Once a broadcaster joins your team, they will be placed in each active team sponsor based on that sponsor's setting to place broadcasters as inactive or active, unless that sponsor campaign setting is set not to automatically add all team broadcasters.

## Removing a team member
1. Click on "Remove from Team" under the dropdown menu at the top right of your Team Preview to open the broadcaster removal modal.
2. Type your broadcaster's name in the input field and click "Submit" to remove them from your team.

If they are active on any team sponsors, they will be automatically be placed as inactive.

## Adding a Sponsor
1. Click on "Add a sponsor" under the dropdown menu at the top right of your Team Preview to open the sponsor creation modal.
2. Enter your sponsor's name.
3. Enter a Start date. Campaigns that begin in the future will not have live components or metrics until the start of the sponsor campaign. An optional end date will determine when the sponsor campaign is automatically archived.
4. (Optional) Enter additional guidelines to be displayed under each broadcaster's profile. This may include promotion tips, best practices, or general notes about the sponsorship.
5. (Optional) Toggle the "Automatically add all team broadcasters" checkbox to add your broadcasters to the sponsor individually at a later time instead of adding them all on sponsor campaign creation.   
6. (Optional) Toggle the "Place broadcasters as inactive by default" checkbox to place all of your broadcasters as inactive in the sponsor campaign instead of active by default.   
7. Click submit to create your sponsor.

Broadcasters on your will be active in the sponsor campaign by default. The Live Graphic will display in their live graphic layer, the Twitch Chatbot and Twitch Chat Commands will appear in their chat room when live, and viewership data will be tracked. Broadcasters added as inactive will not have their Live Graphics, Twitch Chatbot and Twitch Chat Commands appear on stream until the broadcaster is activated under the management tab.

## Removing a Sponsor
1. Click on the "X" to the right of the sponsor.
2. Select to either end the sponsor campaign, or delete it outright.

Ended sponsors will no longer have active components. Live graphics and Chatbot components will no longer appear on stream, and broadcasters will be sent a new broadcaster action to delete all Banner graphics from this sponsorship. The sponsor will still appear on your team dashboard and sidebar, and will contain all metrics from the duration of the sponsorship for reference.

Deleting a sponsor campaign will delete it permanently from Advocate and all components will be deactivated.
