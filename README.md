# Advocate 1.1

The Advocate platform supports 5 user types.

*Brand Managers* are available for brand marketing managers to perform influencer campaigns. They are not able to create their own campaigns, instead requiring an Advocate admin to create a campaign following their desired parameters. They may invite broadcasters to their campaign once created. They may also create target links, labels, reports, and components with the respective component type enabled on the campaign.

*Team Managers* are available for managers of a specific gaming organization that manages broadcasters. They are assigned any number of teams to manage, and can invite and remove broadcasters from teams, as well as create and delete campaigns belonging to the team (referred to as sponsors in the context of teams), and may create all the same components as brand managers with the following component types enabled by default: Live graphics, Twitch Chatbot, Chatbot Commands, Banner Graphics, and Suggested Tweets. They receive additional customization options such as transition times for Live Graphics and Chatbot posts.

*Admins* are Advocate staff given full privileges on the platform, as well as access to every campaign. They may interfere with all existing campaigns including but not limited to component creation and broadcaster management.

*Read-Only* accounts are available for non-interactive stakeholders in a campaign. They may see all metrics for the campaigns assigned to their account, but may not create, update, or delete any data. Brand managers who gain access to a campaign owned by a team will also see the campaign displayed in Read-Only mode, as only managers of that team should be able to edit data on the campaign.

*Broadcaster Accounts* are Twitch-linked broadcasters accounts for live-streamers. Once on a campaign, they will receive instructions on how to perform campaign requirements on their dashboard, but do not see anything related to the campaign that a manager would see.

This repository contains user-facing documentation for *Team Managers*, *Brand Managers*, and *Broadcaster Accounts*. It also contains special-use documentation for extra features, internal developers, quality assurance, and tips & tricks.
