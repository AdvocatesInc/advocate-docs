# Broadcaster Onboarding Guide

### Creating Your Account
Advocate broadcaster accounts are tied to Twitch accounts. Log in using Twitch at **https://my.adv.gg/streamerlogin** to log in to your broadcaster dashboard. If you received a campaign invite link, but you don't have an account already, don't worry! We'll create one for you when you join the campaign.

By default, you'll see four setup actions in your *Action Queue* on your dashboard. This is where your broadcaster actions for all campaigns are displayed. Each one is an instruction to perform for your campaign, such as adding a Banner Graphic image and link to your Twitch Panels, or sending out a Tweet using the designated copy. Once you've completed all of the actions in your account, you're all set to stream!

If a twitch chat bot is enabled for your channel, you'll see messages displayed below your *Action Queue* on your dashboard. This lets you know what messages will be periodically posted in your Twitch chat when you go live.


### Default Actions
These are the default broadcaster actions you'll need to complete as part of your campaign setup once you've logged in. Additional broadcaster actions specific to your campaigns will be shown afterwards on your *Action Queue*.
