# The Dashboard Tab

This tab shows monthly stats of your channel, as well as any actions that need to be taken by you. The monthly stats include how many viewable minutes your stream has, as well as how much many times your ads have been clicked, and how much you been paid by the brands. The actions show what you need to do to meet brand expectations. Finally, the active chat bot messages show which messages are showing in your stream's chat, and at what frequency they're shown at.

### Monthly Stats

These stats cover what you've done in the last month towards campaign progression.

**Minutes Watched**: This stat records the viewable minutes your stream has accrued. Time watched is the total time streamed this month multiplied by your average viewer count.

**Clicks**: This stat records how many times your components have been clicked by viewers. This can help you see how well you're doing in your campaigns.

**Pay To Date**: This is the estimated running total for payment in the current month.

## Your Action Queue

Actions are required to be completed prior to being active in a campaign. To use the Action Queue, simply scroll through each action item in the queue and mark them as completed by clicking the checkbox in the bottom right corner. Once you mark an action as completed, it cannot be reversed. Do not mark an action completed if you have not yet followed the instructions for that item.

## your Chat Bot Messages

This allows you to view which Chat Bot messages will be posted in your stream when you go live, at a 20 minute-interval. The Chat Bot will only post if there have been at least 20 non-bot messages since the last post.
