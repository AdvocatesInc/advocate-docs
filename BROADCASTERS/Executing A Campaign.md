# Executing A Campaign



## Using the Action Queue

To use the Action Queue, simply scroll through each action item in the queue and mark them as being completed. To do this, click the checkbox in the bottom right corner. Once you mark an action as being completed, it cannot be reversed. Do not mark an action completed if you have not yet followed the instructions for that action item.
