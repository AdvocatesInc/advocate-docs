# The Channel Tab

This tab shows which channels you have in your campaign. Each channel has stats on relevant information, such as how many people have clicked on their ads, and how many viewed minutes each channel has.

### Total Visits

This stat is the combined clicks of both the banner graphic, and chat bot. This gives an easily viewable number to how well a channel is doing in terms of direct views.

### CVM

CVM stands for Clicks per Million Viewed Minutes. This is calculated by how many clicks a streamer gets per million viewable minutes. This allows for a more average analysis of how well a stream is doing.

### Twitch Viewable Minutes

This is how many viewable minutes they channel has from their Twitch stream. This number is calculated by how many minutes they stream has been shown, multiplied by how many viewers the stream had on average.

### Banner Graphic Clicks

### Twitch Chat Bot Clicks

This stat shows how many times the chat bot's ad has been clicked. It allows brands to see how effective their text based ads are.
