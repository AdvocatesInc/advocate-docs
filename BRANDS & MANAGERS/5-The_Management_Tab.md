5. The Management Tab
================

The Management Tab contains campaign management tools for broadcaster participation in the campaign, as well as the optional *Chatbot* account selection for manager accounts with elevated permissions.

## Adding a broadcaster to your campaign
`Only team managers have the ability to invite broadcasters to a campaign`

Broadcaster participation in campaign is done in two steps.

## Inviting a broadcaster to your campaign

1. Navigate to the Management Tab of your desired campaign.
2. Click the "Invite a Broadcaster" button to open the invitation modal.
3. Type your broadcaster's name in the input field and click "Send" to send an invitation, or copy and paste the invite link using your communication method of choice.

If you sent them an invitation, the broadcaster will then be prompted to log into their dashboard by receiving an email notifying them of the invitation. Once they log in, they will see a campaign invitation at the top of their dashboard, with the option to accept or decline. You may see all active invites under the "See Sent Invites" modal of the management tab.

If you sent them an invite link, the broadcaster will be prompted to log in through Twitch, and will automatically have accepted the campaign. If no broadcaster account was found for their Twitch account, Advocate will create their account & dashboard, and automatically add them to the campaign.

Please respect the Advocate influencers by only sending campaign invitations to the appropriate broadcasters.

## The Campaign Staging Area

Once broadcasters have accepted an invitation, they are moved to a staging area of the campaign. They will then appear under the *Inactive Broadcasters* section of the management tab and will receive all relevant campaign broadcaster actions such as their *Banner Graphic* assets. This area exists to allow a broadcaster to set up their campaign assets prior to being activated in the campaign. Live *Component Types* such as *Chat Bot Messages* or *Live Graphics* will not appear while a broadcaster is set as Inactive.

Only when a broadcaster is approved and placed correctly into the *Active Broadcasters* column of the management tab will they begin to accumulate *Viewable Minutes* to be counted towards this campaign.

Once you have confirmed outside of the platform that a broadcaster is ready to begin campaign participation, click on the *Active* button to the right of the broadcaster's name under the *Inactive Broadcasters* section of the management tab.

If a broadcaster becomes unable to fulfill the requirements of the campaign at a later time, he may be placed back into the *Inactive Broadcasters* section by clicking on the *Deactivate* button to the right of the broadcaster's name under the *Active Broadcasters* section of the management tab. The platform will save the time periods where the broadcaster was active, and will continue to count his metrics towards the campaign.

If you prefer inviting broadcasters directly to the campaign under the *Active Broadcasters* column, you may toggle the option at the top right of the management tab.

## Setting the Twitch Chat Bot account

`Chatbot Accounts should not be used as a regular broadcaster account on Advocate. If you sign in to a broadcaster dashboard using a designated chatbot account, the chat bot will lose permission to post through that account`

The Advocate *Twitch Chat Bot* will post through the Twitch account *advogg* by default. To allow the chat bot to post through a specific Twitch Account, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are either signed in to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) with the account you wish to use, or not signed in with any other account.
2. Navigate to the Management Tab of your desired campaign.
3. Click on the "Twitch Chat Bot Account" button to open the *Chatbot Account* modal.
4. Click on the "Authorize New Twitch Account" button to log in with the account you wish to use, and accept all permissions.
